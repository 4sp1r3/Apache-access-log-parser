Apache access log parser
========================

Application allows you to write custom plugins to exctract
data from the Apache web server access logs, including data enrichment.

Fork of project found at:
http://www.sysadminpy.com

Application structure
---------------------

Application is split into three parts:

* The main application script (`http_log_parser.py`), which reads in the log lines
  and calls the plug-in framework
* The plug-in manager framework (`manager.py`), which handles the module loading
  and data passing functions
* The plug in modules (`plugins/plugin_*.py`). These modules implement the data
  gathering and processing functions.

Changing the log format
-----------------------

By default the application recognises the "combined" access log line format, which
is defined in the Apache configuration as:

    LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
 
You can change the format structure by specifying it in the `LogLineGenerator`
constructor call. For example, if you are using a "Common Log Format" change
the following code:

    def main():
        ...
        log_generator = LogLineGenerator()
        ...

to:

    def main():
        ...
        log_generator = LogLineGenerator(log_format='%h %l %u %t %r %>s %b')
        ...

Developing the plug-in modules
------------------------------

All plug-in modules mus be placed in the `plugins/` directory. The filename
must be of the following format: `plugin_<plugin_name>.py`. The basic plug-in
module skeleton is:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    from manager import Plugin
    
    class GeoIPStats(Plugin):
    
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            # plugin initialisation function
            ...
    
        def process(self, **kwargs):
            # this will be called for every line retrieved from the log file
            # the fields can be accessed as 'kwargs['remote_host']
            # the full listing of all available dictionary keys and their
            # mapping to the Apache log directives is defined in the
            # main application file
            ...

        def report(self, **kwargs):
            # this will be called when there are no more log entries left
            # this is the opportunity for the plug-in to calculate and
            # print some reports
            ...

Usage
-----

Running the main application will automaticaly load all the available plug-in
modules from the `plugins` directory. All files in the `logs` directory
are considered to be the Apache web server log files.
